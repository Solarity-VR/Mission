# Solarity
Solarity will make an open-source vr metaverse built on the Solana ecosystem for users, developers and entrepreneurs.

<h2>Properties of Solarity</h2>
<li>Solarity's biggest force will be the user's possibility of doing whatever he wants virtually without having to have any programming skills. 
<li>New Solarity projects are included in the metaverse through partnerships with the Solana ecosystem and VR developer studios.
<li>Most of the harvested VERSE goes to people that have directly worked on the project.
<li>A fraction of the harvested VERSE flows to those who hold VERSE in the project's dependencies.
<li>Solarity is a freely transferrable and exchangeable asset. It will be implemented as an SPL token, meaning that it can be bought or sold using <a href="https://raydium.io/"> Raydium. </a>

<h2>The VERSE token</h2>

Every users from the first to the #1.3M receives:
<br>5*(100-7.7ln(x/3 +1) tokens where x means how many users are currently registered on the platform. 
<br>1st user: 500 VERSE, <br>2nd user: 488.92 VERSE
<br>100th user: 363.85, 10â€™000th user: 187.68

This will allocate 50M Tokens to the first 1.3M users of the platform, rewarding the early ones through our distribution function.
<h2>Rewards for VERSEholders</h2>
Solarity aims to incentivize the building and holders community with these steps:

<ol>
  <li>1 VERSE token is equal to 100 square metres inside the Solarity subDAPP, and only PI*100M of VERSE token will ever exist.
  <li>When the Solarity's DAO will be completed, the protocol's revenue will be distributed to token holders in $SOL terms.
  <li>Holders of VERSE tokens can receive airdrops from projects launching on the Solarity Metaverse.

  </ol>


<h2>Solarity as world user-aggregator metaspace</h2>
We truly believe that Solarity can be a revolutionary virtual space where the user is completely free of learn, build, play or trade whatever he wants:

  <li>It provides a new way to support an open-source project: by giving it space on the metaverse and the ability to offer a Virtual Reality experience without having to code everything.
  <li>It provides a way for creators to support their work, with various virtual NFT marketplaces and art galleries where they can be directly rewarded from users-
  <li>It provides computing power to creators, schools and users to render and create anything they can think of.
  <li>It provides rewards for early investors in successful projects, both via Solarity appreciation, and via Airdrops from dependent projects.

<h2>Current Status</h2>
The Solarity project is still in extremely early stages. Development has not yet started.

We believe that before we can responsibly start work on Solarity, we need a robust, transparent, and gaming-resistant way to attribute credit in open-source subDAPPS. 
We need to develope the DAO, once we have that we can start thinking of creating us with partners the most complete metaverse accessible to everybody.

Without a clear and fair composition, the Solarity metaverse can become corrupt and unsustainable. That is why we want more people to activly be members and have decisional power on the future of Solarity.

For that reason, we're focusing our efforts first on building Solarity's DAO Once it is ready, we'll start building out Solarity, starting with developing partnerships with new projects on the Solana ecosystem and with VR developer studios.

<h2>Getting Involved</h2>
Solarity needs a lot of ideas and hands to develope this metaverse. If you want to get involved in Solarity or learn more about it, the best way is to join the Solarity community.
